# For Future Me

The following are still to be done!

  - User Settings (Figma / JS)
  - Sellers Page (Prototype / Figma / JS)
  - Trade Page (Prototype / Figma / JS)
  - Seller Inventory (Prototype / Figma / JS)
  - Support (Prototype / Figma / JS)
  - Search Filters (Prototype / Figma / JS)
  - Header Menu (Prototype / Figma / JS)

These could be reconsidered

    - Browse Cards Table (Use Grid instead?)
    - Card Details / Listing Page (Use Grid Instead?)

There could be more to do I have yet to consider.

Rememember, a number of components already exist, and to use FRAMES!

One last note, we still require code to connect everything
